<h1>WHY ENROL FOR THE PMP CERTIFICATION VIRTUAL TRAINING COURSE?</h1>
Standout from the Rest of Your Peers: 
<li>	According to PMI (2019), the PMP certification is the gold standard of project management.</li>

<li>	The PMP signifies that you speak and understand the global language of project management and connects you to a community of professionals, organizations and experts worldwide. </li>
<li>	Become a PMP and become a project hero.</li>
Gain Global Recognition: 
<li>	Recognized and demanded by organizations worldwide, the PMP validates your competence to perform in the role of a project manager, leading and directing projects and teams.</li> 
<li>	You can find PMPs leading projects in nearly every country and, unlike other certifications that focus on a particular geography or domain, the PMP® is truly global. </li>
<li>	As a PMP, you can work in virtually any industry, with any methodology and in any location. 
Improve Your Earning Prospects:</h1> 
<li>	The PMP can also provide a significant advantage when it comes to salary and earning potential.</li> 
<li>	Previous studies indicate that PMP certified professionals earn higher salaries (20% higher on average) than those without a PMP certification.</li>
